# Need of Project
When classes are large, taking attendance of students is a time-consuming task for university 
instructors. The Paper and Pen method to take attendance is slow and the paper system 
needed a data entering phase to produce reports, which also had comparable issues. 
The average age of smartphone users, according to statistics, is 26 years old. Hence, this project 
addresses the issue of such a waste of lecture time and proposes a method that offers to reduce 
it by approximately 90% in view of the widespread use of smartphones among university 
students. The suggested solution provides a QR code that students can scan using a specific 
smartphone app. The application will be able to verify the studentâ€™s attendance using the code 
and the student identity it has collected.
In this manner, this method will not only save the time but also the effort that lecturers were 
expected to put in during each lesson. It will expedite the taking of attendance and offer plenty 
of time for the lecture to be delivered appropriately.
